**Modern PDF Preview** is a next-generation PDF viewer for VS Code, designed for speed, accuracy, and productivity. 

It is built on top of **[PDFium WASM](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries)** and wrapped with **[embed-pdf-viewer](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer)**, delivering a Chrome-grade rendering experience directly inside your editor.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 High Performance
Powered by **WebAssembly (WASM)**, this extension renders large PDFs instantly without slowing down VS Code. Smooth scrolling and zooming come standard.

### 🖊️ Annotation & Saving
Review and mark up documents directly.
- **Highlight** important text.
- **Draw** ink signatures or diagrams.
- **Add Notes** and comments.
- **Direct Save**: Press `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (macOS) to directly overwrite the PDF file with your modifications.

### 🌐 Universal Support
Works everywhere you use VS Code.
- **Desktop**: Full features supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Web**: Supports VS Code for Web (vscode.dev) and GitHub Codespaces.
    - **Note**: The Web version is optimized for **viewing only**. Other features (like annotation saving) are not guaranteed to work in the browser environment.
- **Privacy-First**: All rendering happens locally. Your data never leaves your machine (or browser sandbox).

### ⚙️ Configuration

Customize the initial viewer state in your VS Code settings:

- `modernPdfViewer.defaultZoomLevel`: Initial zoom (e.g., `page-width`, `page-fit`, `100%`).
- `modernPdfViewer.defaultSpreadMode`: Initial spread (e.g., `none`, `odd`, `even`).

### 🎨 Seamless Integration
- **Theme Sync**: Automatically adapts to Light, Dark, and High Contrast themes.
- **Rich Toolbar**: Thumbnails, Outline/Bookmarks, Search, Print, and Presentation Mode.

## ⚠️ Resource Management Notice

- **Multiple Webviews**: Each PDF document opens in its own independent Webview container.
- **No Automatic Recycling**: The extension **does not** implement an automatic LRU (Least Recently Used) recycling mechanism for open documents.
- **Memory Usage**: To ensure high performance and context retention (`retainContextWhenHidden: true`), Webviews are kept in memory even when hidden.
- **Recommendation**: Please manually close PDF tabs you are no longer using to free up system resources, especially when dealing with very large files.
